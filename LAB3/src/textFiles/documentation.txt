For my Symbol Table I chose to implement 3 separate Hash Tables, one for identifiers, one for int constants and one for string constants.
The hashTable is implemented over a hashmap.
findbypair will return an object of type T (the class is generic), getting the item from the position on the list at the position in the map
contains returns true or false if the element that we want to add is not existent
